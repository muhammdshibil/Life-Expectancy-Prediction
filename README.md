### A life expectancy prediction machine learning model is a type of predictive model that utilizes statistical algorithms and historical data to estimate an individual's expected remaining years of life. The model is trained on a dataset that contains information on various factors that are known to impact life expectancy such as age, gender, medical history, lifestyle habits and so on.

The project would involve obtaining and cleaning a dataset, selecting appropriate features, and training the model using supervised machine learning techniques. The model can then be used to predict life expectancy for new individuals based on their inputted information.
It could also be further improved by fine-tuning the model and incorporating new data as it becomes available.
